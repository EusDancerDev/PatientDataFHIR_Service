1. **Database structure**
  1.1 Yes, the `staff` table should be created in the same database where the patient data is stored, that is, the `KM0` database.
  1.2 Certainly not, that table will only contain data mentioned in the point 1.2 in the file @next_steps_prompt.md. I'll mention it again:
    - `index`: primary key, autoindex, increment +1
    - `username`: not a nickname, but a real-world compatible name
    - `usersurname`: surname of the subject
    - `password`: password following the basic security standards:
      * Minimum length of 8 characters
      * One uppercase letter at least
      * One lowercase letter at least
      * One special, non-word character
    - `role`: role of the professional that will make use of the web service:
      `admin`: meaning an administrative, taking care of staff hiring, measurement equipment availability, etc.
      `medical`: healthcare professional.
    Regarding the password, a common issue sounds to me: some special characters are sort of escaped instead of treating them as literals; if my memory serves, this issue is fixed using the `text` subclass of the package SQLAlchemy.

2. **Authentication Service**
  2.1 Not for now, but we will keep a back door for a future implementation, probably empty or abstract classes. Just write them, but we won't use them **for now**.
  2.2 Absolutely! After doing some research, I found `argon2` library the best to generate hashed passwords and store them in the `staff` table, under the column `password`. Here is a snippet that ChatGPT got for me:
  ```python
  from argon2 import PasswordHasher

  ph = PasswordHasher()
 
  # Generate a hashed password
  hash = ph.hash("FakePassword123")
  ```
  When creating the table `staff`, for each registry, create a fake password, use the above snippet and store it in the table via Python artifacts.
  
  2.3 The point 2.1 only applies for just a couple of empty or abstract classes, so we will do the same for the rate limiting for failed login attempts. Let's set 3 login attempts, and after that, let's make the system block (or sleep) for any amount of minutes you decide.

3. **Role-Based Access**
  3.1 No, because all data tables referred to in @vital_signs_tables.py are the basics.
  3.2 No, for the `admin` role, we just retrieve from all data tables that will appear in the new file `operational_tables.py` that you'll create.

4. **Data Formatting**
  4.1 Certainly yes. Below is an example of an operational FHIR v5 data. This would typically use the Device resource â€” ideal for storing info about things like monitors, infusion pumps, or ventilators:

  ```json
  {
    "resourceType": "Device",
    "id": "monitor-001",
    "identifier": [
      {
        "system": "http://hospital.smartdevices.org/monitor-ids",
        "value": "MON-3421"
      }
    ],
    "type": {
      "coding": [
        {
          "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
          "code": "86184003",
          "display": "Vital signs monitor"
        }
      ]
    },
    "manufacturer": "MediCore Systems",
    "model": "MedView X200",
    "version": "4.3.1",
    "status": "active",
    "udiCarrier": {
      "deviceIdentifier": "12345678901234"
    },
    "location": {
      "display": "ICU Room 5 - Bed A"
    }
  }
  ```

  4.2 No, because all error handling is already done.


5. **Integration Approach**
  - I'm told to develop a separate web service, so `a)` is the answer.

6. **Operational Data**
  6.1 Certainly yes.
  6.2 Not for now, just implement empty or abstract classes for further implementation in the future.

7. **Security Considerations**
  7.1 Not for now.
  7.2 Yes.

8. **Testing Requirements**
  8.1 Yes, do it and we'll see how long we need this test suite
  8.2 No, I'll trust your gut. Just create the data
